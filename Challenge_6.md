# World_Weather_Analysis
Challenge_6
The purpose of the repositopry is to provide access to three technical analyses. The deliverables include:
Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
In this analisys, it was generated a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieved the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data gathered in module 6, the API skills were required to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then, it was created a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data. Files include code in Pandas under Weather_Database.ipynb and Data Base under WeatherPy_Database.csv file.

Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
In this analysis, it was used input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then it was used those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, it was showed those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers. Files include code in Pandas under Vacation_Search.ipynb and Data Base under WeatherPy_vacation.csv file and the image of the Weather Analysis for the different countries as WeatherPy_vacation_map.png 

Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
In this analysis, it was used input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then it was used those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, it was showed those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers. Files include code in Pandas under Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb and the images of the Travel Map and Travel Map Markers for the different cities in the trip itinerary as WeatherPy_travel_map.png and WeatherPy_travel_map_markers.png
